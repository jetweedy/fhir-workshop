# fhir-workshop

This project has several folders:

 - **launchable** contains some files and instructions for running a demo of a SMART on FHIR app launch using a demo app launcher provided by smarthealthit.com.
 - **python** contains a very simplistic Flask app that accepts a name search term, looks up matches, and links them to some barebones 'details' pages.
 - **nodeapp** contains a very barebones skeleton of a potential Node.js application. It does nothing but say hello, but has a few pieces in place to get started using a MySQL database and setting up some routes if you want to make an app in it.

You can find more information about each in their respective README.md files. (If any... again, some of this is still being tweaked.)
