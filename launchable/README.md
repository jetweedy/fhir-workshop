# Demo and Use:

These files have been uploaded to the following location on my server:

https://jonathantweedy.com/www/FHIR/launch/

To use that demo, you can do the following:
1. Visit this Demo Launcher: https://launch.smarthealthit.org/
2. Enter this URL in the field near the bottom:
https://jonathantweedy.com/www/FHIR/launch/smartlaunch.html
3. Click "Launch App"

There you can see it in action. You can also copy it to your own web space, modify the URLs appropriately, and edit the smartapp.html code to do what you would like. Launch instructions would be the same, but you'd be using your own URLs instead.
